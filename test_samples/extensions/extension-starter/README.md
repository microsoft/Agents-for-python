## Extension Starter Sample

This is a simple example that extends the Agents 365 SDK for Python. This is not meant to be a full outline of how to organize a repo for extension development.

From this directory, you may run a sample that uses the extension capabilities with:

```bash
python -m src.sample.main
```

To interact with this sample, we recommend the [Microsoft 365 Agents Playground](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/agents-sdk/test-with-toolkit-project?tabs=windows). This well let you mock up the invoke activities, the dummy channel data, and so on.
