# tests.Dockerfile
#
# Multi-runtime test image. Agents run as subprocesses at test time (via
# run_agent.ps1), so Python, Node, .NET, and PowerShell are all present.
# Nothing agent-specific is baked in — the repo is mounted at /repo at runtime.
#
# Build:  docker build -f environments/local/tests.Dockerfile -t agents-test .
# Run:    docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/repo" agents-test environments/local/tests/

# .NET SDK 8 + PowerShell are pre-installed in this image, eliminating the need
# for the Microsoft package repo and its signing key.
